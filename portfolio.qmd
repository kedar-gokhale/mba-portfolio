## Appendix

This portfolio was created with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM), ChatGPT to be more precise, as it assisted me in the brainstorming and rough drafting process. I asked the LLM to come up with a sample structure of a one-page MBA portfolio and sample descriptions of the parts such as my bio, accomplishments, and work experience. Although the LLM was a valuable starting point, I still introduced a number of modifications to make sure that the end result was a truly personal product containing my own voice, valid career history, and quantifiable outcomes. Like in the case of the LLM, a generic statement was initially proposed such as: He is an ardent business analyst, who wants to see companies improve. I have changed this to a more concrete and specific description: ‚ÄúResults-driven and detail-oriented professional pursuing a Master of Business Administration in Business Analytics. Over 14 years of experience in designing and implementing solutions.‚Äù All experience sections were also edited and expanded with the help of my actual job titles, employers, metrics, and tools used. The LLM gave me the opportunity to simplify phraseology and proposed construction, but each word was checked, tailored, and rewritten as it was so I can say it is my real experience and key attributes. AI as a collaborative tool enabled me to think critically about how to place myself professionally, as well as remain clear and consistent throughout the portfolio. It also expedited the initial drafting as now I spend less time on drafting the initial work and spend more working on editing designs and layout with Quarto. I recognize and acknowledge the use of ChatGPT in writing the content to be transparent and academically honest.
